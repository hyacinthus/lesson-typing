What about you?\nMike: My dad and I are going fishing at the lake on Saturday. Do you want to come with us?\nSarah: Fishing? I have never been fishing before. Is it difficult?\nMike: No, it's easy! I can teach you. You just need to be patient and wait for the fish to bite.\nSarah: That sounds interesting. What do we need to bring?\nMike: Just bring a hat and some snacks. We have extra fishing rods. We will leave at 8 o'clock in the morning.\nSarah: Okay! I will ask my parents tonight. Thanks for inviting me!\nMike: You're welcome. It will be fun!",
